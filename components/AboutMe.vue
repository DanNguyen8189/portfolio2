            <p>Hello! I'm Dan, a software developer from Los Angeles, California.</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>I graduated from UC San Diego with a B.S. in computer science. 
                During my time there, I discovered my interest in the field and solving problems and 
                met many great people along the way. I look forward to learning more!</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>In my free time, I like making short comic strips and illustrating and posting my work on the web. I also enjoy playing soccer, basketball, and other outdoor activities.</p>
